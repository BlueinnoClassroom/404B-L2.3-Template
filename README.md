## Task

A bank offers **6.5%** interest on savings accounts, compounded annually.

Create a table that shows how much money a person will accumulate over a period of 25 years.

Assuming that the person makes an initial investment of \$1000 and deposits \$100 each year after the first.

Your table should indicate for each year:

- the current balance
- the interest
- the new deposit
- the new balance
